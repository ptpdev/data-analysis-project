# Kickstarter crowdfunding data

The objective of this project is to visualize data with Power BI, KickStarter Projects dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects)

Before visualize data, explore and clean the data first.
1. Use "Column distribution" to explore data, verify null, duplicated, misspelled
2. Remove unnecessary columns, so our model will be less complex
3. Change data type and rename columns for more readable
